   - Optimize performance and support cross-platform usage.  
   - Add additional libraries and plugins.

3. **Stable Release**  
   - Improve stability and enhance security.  
   - Provide deeper support for machine learning models and algorithms.

## Installation Requirements

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- Virtual environment **virtualenv** or **conda** (recommended)
- **Git** (for cloning the project)

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the source code from the repository:
